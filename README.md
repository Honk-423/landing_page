# landing_page

I will be creating a landing page to hone and demonstrate my skills. I struggled quite a bit to understand flexbox, but I've improved a lot and I hope to demonstrate and further hone what I've learned.


Today is May 13th, 2025 and I've just added the finishing touches to this landing page project. I encountered a few hurdles, but after getting past the first one everything else was fairly easy to figure out or find information on. Now, onto what I've learned:


This is more of a reinforcement of something that I already knew, but a lot of issues with flexbox layouts that I've encountered can be fixed by adding more flex containers. For example, when getting multiple elements with display: block; to appear in a row, such as links in a list, it's necessary to add display: flex; to a few of the elements that lists are made up of before it will look right. Getting two elements to appear side by side is also fixed by adding flex containers, and in this case having one element in each.


Padding is more important than I thought. Perhaps in the future I'll find out that there's a better alternative to it, but as of now padding was a major part of what made this project look nice.


Margin is also more important than I previously thought. I didn't underestimate the importance of margin nearly as much as I did padding, but after learning more about flex I thought gap would be able to replace margin quite frequently, however I no longer think this is true.


Chrome has, I believe, a default margin. It really made me think that something was wrong when I was creating the header.


The most important thing that I've learned is to look things up when I'm stuck. I thought I was supposed to do projects without any help up until recently, and thankfully I managed well enough thus far, but even experienced coders and programmers have to google things frequently. 


I think that covers most of what I've learned. It may or may not seem like I haven't learned much to someone reading this, but the experience that I gained from creating this webpage was invaluable. My understanding of what I'm doing has grown a lot, and I'm incredibly grateful to everyone that worked on The Odin Project.
